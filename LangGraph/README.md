# üéì EduTrack LangGraph

EduTrack LangGraph is an AI-powered multi-agent assistant that uses **LangGraph** and **LangChain** to provide personalized academic, wellness, career, and performance guidance to students.

This project demonstrates how intelligent agent routing, dynamic prompt grounding, and real-time data integration can support students with actionable and contextual responses using CSV datasets.

- Trigger appropriate specialized agents (academic, wellness, career, performance).
- Ground each agent's response with context from relevant datasets (GPA, stress levels, career goals, etc.).
- Log agent flow for traceability and debugging.
- Deliver all responses in under 3 seconds using LangGraph's composable graph execution.
